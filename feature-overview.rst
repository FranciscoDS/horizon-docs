Feature overview
=======================================

Sane and simple part management
-------------------------------

Easily manage parts, packages and symbols with the :doc:`pool manager <pool-mgr>` (also see :doc:`What is a Pool? <pool-why>`):

Assign pins to pads in the part editor:

Easy part creation
------------------

Simply add pins as they're listed in the datasheet:

Horizon also ships with script templates for importing industry-standard
formats like IBIS saving you the tedious work of typing what's in the
datasheet.

Loves beginners and power users alike
-------------------------------------

Just press the spacebar and get a list of all the actions you can perform. These actions can be bound to customizible single key shortcuts or to vim-like multi key sequences.

A schematic editor that knows what you're doing
-----------------------------------------------

Schematics aren't just about lines and labels. Horizon's schematic
editor knows about nets and asks you when merging them:

It places junctions where they should be:

It also reorients texts automatically, so you don't end up with
hard-to-read reference designators:

Buses aren't foreign to horizon either:

Interactive router with online DRC
----------------------------------

By using the interactive router originally developed for KiCad, routing
tracks becomes a breeze. Of course, it respects your design rules.

Powerful rules
--------------

With powerful and flexible rules, horizon can check and adjust your
design to meet its constraints:

If something doesn't meet your rules, horizon exactly tells what's wrong
in which place:

Industry-standard fabrication outputs
-------------------------------------

When your design is ready for fabrication, simply export
industry-standard RS-274X gerber and NC-Drill files:

3D View
-------

Look at your board as if you were holding it in your hands. Using the
explode slider, you can pull the layers apart.

Customizable color schemes for both schematic and board editors
---------------------------------------------------------------

Decoration affects people, and people are different â€“ do your own thing or select from the existing color schemes.
