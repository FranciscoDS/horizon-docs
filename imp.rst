The interactive manipulator
=======================================

In order to provide a unified user experience and enable code reuse, the
editors for symbols, schematic, padstack, package and board are all
based on the interactive manipulator.

Selecting things
----------------

Initially, the "hover select" mode is active. It simply selects the
smallest object under the cursor. Click or drag to select objects
permanently. Hit "Esc" for returning to hover select mode.

Tools
-----

To edit the things on screen, use the tools. Tools can be started in
multiple ways:

-  By typing in the tool's key sequence. Available key sequences are
   listed by clicking the help button in the top right corner or typing
   "?".
-  By using the tool popup that shows up when pressing the space bar.
   Just start typing for the tool you're looking for or browse through
   the list.
-  By right clicking an object. This will bring up context menu listing
   all the tools relevant to what's selected.
-  One of the buttons in the top bar.

After having started a tool, it receives all keyboard and mouse input.
Look at the bar that appeared at the bottom of the canvas to see what
pressing keys will to in this particular tool.

The Grid
--------

Holding down "Alt" will reduce the grid spacing by a factor of 10.
